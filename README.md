# SoftwareRasterizer

I created a software rasterizer in an attempt to better my understanding of computer graphics. The main goal was to understand how a computer identifies color, 3D geometric shapes, and ray tracing to decompose the 3D objects and turn them into a 2D array of pixels and dots. The project was all about understanding the graphics pipeline. It features triangle rasterization, perspective correct interpolation, texture mapping, bilinear interpolation, and model loading.
